//OOPS : 
//1) classes : collection of data and functions. // data member and member functions.
//2) object : instance of a class.// runtime entity. // it is use access the elements of a class.
//3) encapsulations : wrapping of data and function together is known as encapsulation.
//4) data abstraction : data hiding. // by using private keyword.
//5) inheritance : parent child relationship. // code reusbility.// (private function cannot be inherited).
//6) polymorphism : same name many form. 
                   //it has two types.
